# Web App in the User's Home Screen (Fireworks)

Implementation of [Add Your Web App to a User's Home Screen codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/add-to-home-screen/index.html), a tutorial for automatic (with user's permission) add a shortcut of your app in the mobile's home screen.

## How to Setup

First you need:

* [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb)
* Chrome 52 or above

After you clone this code, open the Web Server and set the folder to the root folder. You will recieve the Web Server URL that you will need to see the updates, but first, check the box "Automatically show index.html" and don't close this window.

The code used for the test was the Paul Lewis's [Firewoks](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/add-to-home-screen/archive/master.zip), so if you click on the screen, fireworks you appear, but the shortcut only works in mobile version.
